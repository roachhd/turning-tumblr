==============

An easy but awesome full screen background filled with rotating sexy tumblr gifs. use any tumblr account without needing authentication.

Just include `app.js`, `jquery` and your good to go. See the demo folder for how to include it.

The gh-pages branch includes the project page, which has a Tumblr background, and a bunch of demos. 
The master beach has the `base.html` and `app.js` as well as a `demo` folder to show usage. But it's super easy to use and modify some variables.
